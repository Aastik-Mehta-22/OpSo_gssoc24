However, this presents a privacy risk, as Google’s code completely controls the Sign-in button and includes cross-site trackers. We would like to avoid this. One solution is to use a library based on an open authentication standard and to interact with Google Sign-In via web tokens. This will also allow us to support authentication using other social platforms. Expected Outcome: Tirtha should move away from Google Auth, and the privacy issue should be resolved.",
