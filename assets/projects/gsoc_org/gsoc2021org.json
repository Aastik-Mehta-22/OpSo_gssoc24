Over time, we attracted international young professionals of the space industry and the local maker community and thus becoming a full-fledged citizen science project.</p>\n<p>We are a community project of several projects of different Teams in Stuttgart and globally. Together we do several things.\nWe track cubesats with the Distributed Ground Station Network Team at the Institute for Photogrammetry and try to be faster than US NORAD. We simulated millions of particles from comets with the Cosmic Dust Team of the Institute for Space Systems at University of Stuttgart for the IMEX project of the European Space Agency (ESA). And we foster other space projects like ep2lab by being an umbrella organisation.</p>\n<p>We are a small organization but having impact within the global space community and helping realizing space exploration by creativity and open access. We are open for everybody interested in space for the betterment of everybody. Feel kindly invited to join our ZULIP chat and ask us everything about space!</p>\n",

A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.\nMultiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, keyMatch can map a resource key /foo/bar to the pattern /foo*.\nWhat Casbin does NOT do:</p>\n<p>Authentication (aka verify username and password when a user logs in)\nManage the list of users or roles. I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities. Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario.\nFor more details, see: <a href=\"https://casbin.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://casbin.org/</a></p>\n",

The <a href=\"http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HEP Software Foundation</a> facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://home.cern\" target=\"_blank\">CERN</a> (European Organization for Nuclear Research) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.</p>\n<p>The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful <a href=\"http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider\" target=\"_blank\">particle accelerator</a> try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.</p>\n<p>The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management, and many others. We look forward to your contributions!</p>\n",

Work in the CHAOSS Project community is largely organized around software and metrics.</p>\n<h3>Why Create CHAOSS?</h3>\n<p>The importance of open source software is no longer in question and its importance raises important questions about how we understand the health of the open source projects we rely on. Unhealthy projects can have negative impacts for the community involved in the project as well as organizations that rely on such projects. In response, people want to know more about the open source projects they are engaged with. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open source contributors want to know where they should place their efforts and know that they are making an impact.</li>\n<li>Open source communities want to attract new members, ensure consistent quality, and reward valuable members.</li>\n<li>Open source companies want to know which communities to engage with, communicate the impact the organization has on the community, and evaluate the work of their employees within open source.</li>\n<li>Open source foundations want to identify and respond to community needs, evaluate the impact of their work, and promote communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In response to these issues, the CHAOSS project develops metrics, practices, and software for making open source project health more understandable. By building measures of open source project health, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency and actionability of open source project health so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.</p>\n<h3>What are CHAOSS Goals?</h3>\n<p>The project goals are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish standard implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community health</li>\n<li>Produce integrated open source software for analyzing software community development</li>\n<li>Develop programs for the deployment of metrics not attainable through online trace data</li>\n<li>Build reproducible project health reports</li>\n</ul>\n",

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting\nChapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the\ncloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed.\nChapel's design and development are being led by HPE in collaboration\nwith academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique\nexperience for students to work on projects involving high-performance\ncomputing, parallel programming, and compiler development.</p>\n<h3>Core features</h3>\n<p><strong>Native Parallelism</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel\nprovides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a\nseparate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism\nfeatures make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and\nprogram.</p>\n<p><strong>Data and Task Locality</strong></p>\n<p>When working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task\nwhich uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in\nperformance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that\nplacement, both within a data structure and outside it.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiresolution Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to\ninitially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until\nthey are as close to the machine as their needs require.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern Language Features</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design,\ntype inference, and features for generic programming.</p>\n<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>\n<p>Existing code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or\nvice-versa) via interoperability features.</p>\n",

Besides providing traditional network-level security, the flexibility of eBPF enables security with the context of application protocols and DNS requests/responses. Cilium is tightly integrated with Envoy and provides an extension framework based on Go. Because eBPF runs inside the Linux kernel, all Cilium functionality can be applied without any changes to the application code or container configuration.</p>\n<p>Cilium receives contributions from a community of more than 200 developers.</p>\n",

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>\n<p>We are building a platform called <strong>EvalAI</strong> as a scalable solution for the research community to fulfill the critical need for evaluating machine learning models. This will help researchers, students, and data scientists to create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges organized around the globe. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking these models, we seek to lower the barrier to entry for participating in the global scientific effort to push the frontiers of machine learning and artificial intelligence, thereby increasing the rate of measurable progress in this domain.</p>\n<p>The platform is used by more than 25 organizations from industry and academia such as Facebook, eBay, IBM, Stanford, MIT, Georgia Tech, etc. It has hosted 90+ AI challenges with 9500+ users who have created 100k+ submissions. It has more than 120+ open-source contributors and 1.3M+ page views since its launch in 2017. Several research organizations like Mapiallary research, IBM research, etc. are using its forked version for hosting their internal challenges instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>\n",

Our data are available publicly at <a href=\"https://cdli.ucla.edu\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli.ucla.edu</a> and our audiences comprise primarily scholars and students, but with growing numbers of informal learners.</p>\n<p>At the heart of cdli is a group of developers, language scientists, machine learning engineers, and cuneiform specialists who develop software infrastructure to process and analyze curated data. To this effect, we are actively developing two projects: Framework Update <a href=\"https://cdli.ucla.edu/news/cdli-core-update\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli.ucla.edu/news/cdli-core-update</a> and Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages <a href=\"https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/</a>. As part of these projects we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages for undertaking automated annotation and translation of Sumerian language texts thus enabling data driven study of languages, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near Eastern civilizations. As part of this platform we are focusing on data standardization using Linked Open Data to foster best practices in data exchange and integration with other digital humanities and computational philology projects.</p>\n",

This information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A KG is a database that stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. \nThe current DBpedia release 2021-01 consists of 21 billion triples (“facts”) and ~750 different “types”. The whole extraction includes 125 languages. It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata). Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first open KGs on the Web. Its knowledge base has several advantages over existing ones: it covers many domains; it represents real community agreement; it automatically evolves as Wikipedia changes, and it is truly multilingual. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia every day. \nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (such as SPARQL).\nHave you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That is the kind of query we are talking about.\nDBpedia has become a high-impact, high-visibility project because of our foundation in excellent Knowledge Engineering as the pivot point between scientific methods, innovation and industrial-grade output. The drivers behind DBpedia are 6 out of the TOP 10 Most Influential Scholars in Knowledge Engineering and the C-level executives of our members.</p>\n",

These tools are also free.</p>\n<p>Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what\nthey want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing\nmore software. Debian comes with over 59000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled\nup in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager (APT), and other\nutilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as\neasily as installing a single application.

We use our expertise in computer science and informatics by developing various enabling tools, technologies, and algorithms to solve specific biomedical and clinical applications. And in doing so help advance our understanding of disease and treatment, and also develop useful software and applications. Members of the department work in a variety of areas that range from machine learning, healthcare middleware that leverages cloud computing, clinical information systems, clinically oriented image analysis, and biomedical knowledge modeling. The driving applications for the various ongoing projects include cancer research, organ transplant, HIV, medical imaging, radiation therapy, and clinical data analytics. All development work that is undertaken is free and open-source.\nWe have had a diverse set of successful GSoC projects in the past. In previous years, GSoC students have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (&gt;1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration and de-duplication platform for SQL and NoSQL databases; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; A GUI for Tensorflow; integrated architectures for biomedical data integration and federation; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data. Many of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences. Some of the projects proved to be so successful that they were adopted in major national/international biomedical research initiatives.</p>\n",

Fortran-lang's flagship projects are the Fortran Standard Library (stdlib, <a href=\"https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib</a>), Fortran Package Manager (fpm, <a href=\"https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm</a>), and the Fortran website (<a href=\"https://fortran-lang.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://fortran-lang.org</a>). In only 14 months, stdlib has had &gt;140 pull requests merged from 23 contributors, with a total of 43 new procedures and types over 11 modules, and continues to grow. Largely modeled after Rust's Cargo, fpm is a build system and package manager dedicated to Fortran with the key goal to improve programmer happiness. Fpm is already capable of building complex Fortran projects, automatically fetching and building dependencies, and bootstrapping itself. The Fortran website provides all the latest information about Fortran compilers, libraries, and community, as well as an actively developed tutorial. Fortran-lang issues monthly newsletters that detail the relevant news and updates to the projects, and distributes them on Twitter and on its mailing list. Finally, the Fortran Discourse (<a href=\"https://fortran-lang.discourse.group\" target=\"_blank\">https://fortran-lang.discourse.group</a>) is a moderated and inclusive online forum for discussion and collaboration, which, since May 2020, has attracted 146 active users from all over the world.</p>\n",

It is also the Brazilian branch of the <a href=\"https://globalframenet.org\" target=\"_blank\">Global FrameNet</a> initiative, an international effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started with <a href=\"https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Berkeley FrameNet</a> in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. Frame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.</p>\n<h4>The Database</h4>\n<p>FN-Br implements a relational database storing a set of frames - or scenes -, the elements structuring these frames, the language specific material (words, MWEs and grammatical constructions), and several typed relations between all those items. Such a database provides a model and a structure for semantic representation of the knowledge about a given language. Currently, FN-Br includes <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/data/\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> about Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.</p>\n<h4>The Applications</h4>\n<p>FN-Br database is the base for the development of different software: a frame-based multimodal web annotation tool, a domain-specific dictionary - the FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary; a system for recommending tourist attractions - m.knob; a semantically enhanced sentence translator and a constructional parser - CARMA.</p>\n",

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 5 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realizing it.</p>\n<p>The FreeBSD Project began 28 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.</p>\n<p>There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>\n<p>In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.</p>\n",

This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.)

When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.</p>\n<p>The goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools.

The current focus of GeomScale is scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. We believe that towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and (limited) Python interfaces, for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling.</p>\n<p>In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. It is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date with orders of magnitude performance in several cases compared to packages that solves the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g. the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration, and data-driven power systems in control.</p>\n",

Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute and coordinate the efforts of groups of volunteers, public servants, university researchers and students enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation. GFOSS is one of the strategic actors for the promotion of OSS throughout Greece (see <a href=\"https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf</a> ). Many public administrations and academic institutions collaborate with GFOSS to implement open source projects and through Google Summer of Code we give the opportunity to students to actively engage in the production and the actual implementation of an open source project. GFOSS also contributes and advices on the development of various open source projects related to e-government and digital transformation in Greece (e,g. <a href=\"https://howto.gov.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://howto.gov.gr/</a> - <a href=\"https://forma.gov.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://forma.gov.gr/</a>) and actively promotes the use of Open Source software and hardware in the Greek primary and secondary education through the Open Educational Technologies Competition (<a href=\"https://openedtech.ellak.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://openedtech.ellak.gr/</a> )</p>\n",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>\n",

Mailman is integrated with the web, making it easy for users to manage their accounts and for list owners to administer their lists. Mailman supports built-in archiving, automatic bounce processing, content filtering, digest delivery, spam filters, and more. You probably use it: Mailman is used to manage many project mailing lists from 3-person teams to some of the biggest corporate support operations.</p>\n<h3>How is the code organized?</h3>\n<p>In Mailman 3, we've divided up the code into a number of sub-projects. We refer to the whole package as \"Mailman Suite\" and there's a few really important pieces you should know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mailman Core - This is the part that actually sends and receives mail and handles subscriber and list information.</li>\n<li>Postorius - A web interface for managing Mailman lists (e.g. subscribing, changing preferences)</li>\n<li>Hyperkitty - A web interface to access GNU Mailman v3 archives. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's also a number of smaller projects that provide the glue to make these pieces work well together, or allow them to be used separately.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>Mailman is a community of developers and users who support people who support people! We're proud to be part of the infrastructure of the Internet.</p>\n",

It provides a concise syntax and powerful code optimizations to achieve both ease of use and high performance. It also provides automatic gradient generation features for machine learning and optimization applications. Halide is used for code generation for several commercial applications including Youtube, Google Pixel, and Adobe Photoshop.</p>\n<p>The central idea of Halide is to decouple the algorithm (\"what\" we want to compute) and schedule (\"how\" are we going to compute it). The algorithm defines the high-level semantics of the program, and the schedule defines the lower-level computation details such as parallelism, order, or storage. The users would define the two separately and explore different ways to accelerate an algorithm. By following this philosophy, we have been able to generate fast Fourier transform code that is faster than fftw, and depthwise separable convolution code that is faster than TensorFlow.</p>\n<p>See Alex Reinking's cppcon talk for an introduction to Halide: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ir_nEfKQ7A\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ir_nEfKQ7A</a></p>\n",

This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.</p>\n<p>Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.</p>\n<p>Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as app development, web technologies, graphics, usability, internationalization, or design.</p>\n",

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2021 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, York University - Canada, Brigham Young University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota, Charles University - Czech Republic, and National University of Singapore.</p>\n<p>JPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.</p>\n<p>JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.</p>\n",

It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.</p>\n<p>Lua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.</p>\n<p>What is Céu?</p>\n<p>Céu provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it.

Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been implemented in a dedicated MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices, algorithms have been moved to the main CPU to save cost. Blurring the boundary between camera devices and Linux often left the user with no other option than a vendor-specific closed-source solution.</p>\n<p>To address this problem the Linux media community is collaborating with the industry to develop a camera stack that is open-source-friendly while still protecting vendor core IP. libcamera was born out of that collaboration and offers modern camera support to Linux-based systems, including traditional Linux distributions, ChromeOS and Android.</p>\n",

A basic ground station up can be set-up using commercial off-the-shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing, 400 stations are online in the SatNOGS Network, and tested globally by University satellite teams, organizations, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the SatNOGS Database and are visualized in the SatNOGS Dashboard.\nFurthermore, the Polaris project can be used to provide insights on satellite telemetry collected by SatNOGS using machine learning technics.</p>\n<p>Libre Space, recently delivered two open-hardware and software PocketQube-class satellites Qubik 1 and Qubik 2, and an open-source hardware and software PocketQube orbital deployment system PicoBus scheduled for launch in 2021Q1 on the inaugural launch of the Firefly Alpha rocket. The Qubik satellites will perform orbital determination and identification experiments and will showcase open-source software and hardware technologies. Additionally, Libre Space, develops an open-hardware and software satellite communication subsystem for CubeSats designed to work seamlessly with the SatNOGS Network.</p>\n<p>Libre Space Foundation is also implementing two European Space Agency activities.

We believe that space exploration should not be restricted to the hands of a few large companies and governments, but that everyone shall be able to contribute to it. Virtually every single person on the planet is fascinated by space – at LibreCube we aim to make it accessible to everyone.</p>\n<h3>What are the concepts of LibreCube?</h3>\n<p>It is great to see that a growing number of communities are forming to liberate access to space. However, the unique proposition of LibreCube are its three core pillars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Source: Everything we do is made available to the public as free and open source from the start. And we only use free and open source tools for our work – this way, really everyone can get involved! </li>\n<li>Free and Open Standards: We rely on proven and tested standards for our system designs, with preference for standards from the space domain. </li>\n<li>Reference Architecture: In order to make all our hardware and software parts to work together and form a system of systems, we use or define standardized interfaces to make it possible to combine and reuse elements for various applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to find out more?</h3>\n<p>Visit our website at <a href=\"https://librecube.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://librecube.org</a> to learn more about what we are currently working on and what is planned.</p>\n<h3>How to get involved?</h3>\n<p>Go to our online discussion channel to join the community and let us hear from you!</p>\n",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.</p>\n<p>We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.</p>\n<p>Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution &amp; skills.</p>\n<p>The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.</p>\n",

It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there! Open source applications such as the MPlayer video player have been extended to run on Liquid Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Liquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.</p>\n",

ML4SCI brings together researchers from universities and scientific laboratories with motivated students to join existing scientific collaborations and contribute to cutting edge science projects across a wide variety of disciplines. Students work on existing problems to develop new machine learning-based approaches and produce open source code that directly contributes to solving these scientific challenges.\nPrior to 2021, some of the ML4SCI projects were part of CERN-HSF umbrella. Since then, ML4SCI has grown to encompass many projects outside of particle physics, and in 2021, ML4SCI operates as a new umbrella organization. We welcome participating machine learning projects from any area of science to take part under the ML4SCI umbrella. \nML4SCI currently includes projects from a variety of fields. For example, some of them explore the uses of machine learning for particle reconstruction and classification in high-energy physics, deep learning-based searches for dark matter in astrophysics, applications of machine learning techniques to data returned from planetary science missions, applications of quantum machine learning to science, and others.\nMachine learning ideas and approaches can be broadly applicable and transferable across the scientific domains. The goals of ML4SCI projects are to grow the open-source community in machine learning for science by addressing important scientific challenges and transferring the knowledge and tools of machine learning across the disciplines. We look forward to your applications!</p>\n",

It is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, soft-matter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis is written by scientists for scientists, who engage with each other in a welcoming community.</p>\n<p>The goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics\" target=\"_blank\">molecular dynamics</a> (MD) simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/used-by/\" target=\"_blank\">new computational tools</a>.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">protein databank</a> (PDB) format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it. Welcoming documentation such as the new <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/UserGuide/\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a> make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited more than a thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.</p>\n",

While the digitization of news has broadly made many sorts of research newly possible, the volume of content and newer trends toward proprietary platforms have significantly increased the barriers for researchers hoping to build on the scholarly traditions of studying attention, representation, influence, and language in online news.</p>\n<p>In addition, the democratization of content authoring has significantly expanded the number of different news sources reporting about any topic or geographic area. The process of\ndiscovering which online media sources to study has become more involved; how does one identify the set of media outlets that exist and decide which are influential? Furthermore, once a set of media sources has been created, collecting their content introduces many technological difficulties.</p>\n<h3>About Media Cloud</h3>\n<p>Media Cloud is an open source data corpus and suite of web-based analytic tools that support research into open web media ecosystems across the globe. Since 2008, Media Cloud has collected a total of over 1.7 billion stories. These data are available to the public via an open source code base available <a href=\"https://github.com/mediacloud/\" target=\"_blank\">on GitHub</a>, a suite of free <a href=\"https://tools.mediacloud.org/\" target=\"_blank\">web tools</a>, and an extensive <a href=\"https://mediacloud.org/support/\" target=\"_blank\">open API</a>. Media Cloud is limited by copyright restrictions from sharing the full text of news articles with external partners. Instead, we surface metadata, data about text content of the documents and URLs of documents indexed.</p>\n<p>Researchers have used Media Cloud to study:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mapping national political discourse</li>\n<li>Online mis/dis-information</li>\n<li>Media self-analysis</li>\n<li>Human rights and social justice media impact</li>\n<li>Media-based art and advocacy.</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "description_html": "<h3>Motivation</h3>\n<p>When working with different technologies and developers of different programming languages, the productivity of the entire team worsens due to the lack of interoperability and communication between them. If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for example, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is usually error prone, time consuming and does not add any value to the final product.</p>\n<h3>Why <a href=\"https://github.com/metacall/core\" target=\"_blank\">MetaCall</a>?</h3>\n<p>The main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or whatever.</p>\n<p>We want to allow polyglot applications to be written in a transparent way, and allow multiple developers to work in the same project using <a href=\"https://github.com/metacall/core/blob/develop/docs/README.md#2-language-support\" target=\"_blank\">different languages</a>.</p>\n<h3>How?</h3>\n<p>MetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language. You can have type safety and at the same time avoid boilerplate in both directions.</p>\n<h3>Extensibility</h3>\n<p>MetaCall addresses the main shortcomings of embedding independent languages separately. Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python, ... or any language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages. Imagine you don't want to use CPython anymore and you want to try PyPy instead because you need performance. Write a new backend and you will only need to change the language tag <strong>\"py\"</strong> by <strong>\"pypy\"</strong> and you are done.</p>\n",

In January 2020, MuseScore introduced a unique engraving and notation style built by its full time designer, Martin Keary and engraver Simon Smith.</p>\n<p>MuseScore can play back scores through a sequencer and SoundFont sample library. Playback is currently being greatly expanded to include VST support. MIDI output to external devices and software synthesisers is also possible.</p>\n<p>The team organise themselves according to a general roadmap published by the product owner every six months, which sets out provisional goals for the internal team. This allows the extended developer community to comment on the roadmap and potentially offer to take ownership over aspects of it. This also allows other contributors to have visibility on aspects of the codebase that may change over the next 6-12 months. In combination with our community organiser, tasks are drawn up and published to provide a well organised collaboration focused on a specific upcoming release.</p>\n<p>All members provide bug tracking support and feedback.</p>\n",

Perhaps more importantly, type annotations act as machine-checked documentation and make your code easier to understand and maintain. Mypy can scale to multi-million line codebases, while providing quick incremental checking through the mypy daemon.</p>\n<p>Mypy lets you freely mix type checked and unannotated code, making it possible to gradually migrate existing codebases to static type checking.</p>\n<h4>What is mypyc?</h4>\n<p>Mypyc is a compiler from a type annotated Python dialect to CPython C extension modules that uses mypy as the front end. It can often significantly speed up Python code. We originally built mypyc to compile mypy, making mypy 4x faster. We are now looking at making mypyc useful for end users as a practical tool to make Python programs and libraries more efficient.</p>\n<p>It's easy to ensure that programs compiled with mypyc continue to also be valid (non-compiled) Python programs. Modules compiled with mypyc can freely interact with interpreted modules. Mypyc lets you compile a few performance-sensitive modules and keep the rest of your program interpreted.</p>\n",

Alongside teacher trainings and gender-sensitive school materials, we focus primarily on developing and expanding our visual open-source programming platform “Open Roberta Lab”.</p>\n<p>As one of the leading institutes for applied AI research in Europe, Fraunhofer IAIS aims to use Open Roberta a way to get more people excited about creating new technologies. We provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for literally everybody: in 2020 alone, more than 3 million people from 120 countries programmed their robots and microcontrollers using the Blockly-based programming language \"NEPO\".</p>\n<p>The Open Roberta Lab is a web application running in every browser. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Especially in times of Corona, this simulation has proven to be of great value. A growing number of robots and microcontrollers are now available as simulations in the Lab.</p>\n<p>Open Roberta is becoming increasingly popular with a worldwide community of teachers. In addition to tutorials that can be created independently via an editor, teachers also have the ability to coordinate their classes' assignments and programs in groups.</p>\n<p>The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the shape of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 14 different robot plugins.  Visit them on <a href=\"https://lab.open-roberta.org\" target=\"_blank\">lab.open-roberta.org</a>!</p>\n<p>Interested? Do good and use your skills to prepare a new generation for the digital world that they can not only use, but also shape!</p>\n",

        "description_html": "<p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases, and if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open-source medical record system framework for developing countries. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self-reliance within resource-constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>\n",

The main objective of the project, called <strong>ProvinciaWiFi</strong> (later renamed <a href=\"https://www.cittametropolitanaroma.it/homepage/elenco-siti-tematici/wifimetropolitano/\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi Metropolitano</a>), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing <strong>digital divide</strong> by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.</p>\n<p>From the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue these goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CASPUR</em> consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.</p>\n<p>The software tools, including the OpenWISP 2 <a href=\"http://openwisp.org\" target=\"_blank\">network management system</a> and different <a href=\"http://netjson.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetJSON</a> implementations are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, hoping this will allow a broader audience to benefit from our work.</p>\n",

        "description_html": "<p>Orcasound is an open source project that makes it easy to listen live for animals that make sounds, like the endangered orcas in Washington State (aka Southern Resident Killer Whales, or SRKWs). We use underwater microphones (hydrophones) deployed in key habitats to listen for the calls, whistles, and clicks that SRKWs make almost continuously -- intense signals that can be heard 10 km away, often before the orcas are visible.</p>\n<p>Since a Kickstarter in mid-2017, <a href=\"http://www.orcasound.net/hacker-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_blank\">key members of our community</a> have built a <a href=\"http://live.orcasound.net\" target=\"_blank\">web app that is connected to 3 hydrophones monitoring the SRKW habitat 24/7</a>. Version 2 of the app, live since May, 2020, lets citizen scientists indicate when they detect orca sounds in the live audio data streams, or other sounds that might harm the orcas, like sonar or noise from ships. The <a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite\" target=\"_blank\">web-app code repository</a> has multiple feature branches. Users of version 2 can also receive a notification when orcas are detected, a feature which makes Orcasound a new conservation tool. We expect version 3, designed for both mobile and desktop for the first time, to begin beta-testing in mid-2021. While users enjoy the live “concert” they are offered a timely call to action -- often aimed at reducing the underwater noise pollution near Seattle which impedes the orcas’ ability to communicate &amp; echolocate scarce salmon.</p>\n<p>Orcasound also maintains repositories with other open source tools that support the web app, as well as bioacoustic analysis in general, and killer whale recovery. You can examine and contribute to all our code at <a href=\"http://github.com/orcasound\" target=\"_blank\">Github.com/Orcasound</a>.</p>\n",

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.</p>\n<h3>How does PEcAn do that?</h3>\n<p>PEcAn consists of 1) state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.</p>\n<h3>Transparency, repeatability, accessibility</h3>\n<p>PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.</p>\n<h3>High functionality and performance</h3>\n<p>In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.</p>\n",

We adhere to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and regularly discuss with artists all around the planet to tackle the hard problems the right way, to make complex tasks easy to accomplish.</p>\n<p>It is a vibrant community-driven project, backed by long standing contributors with a strong interest and experience in multimedia.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>Pitivi is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library in which we take part. With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.</p>\n<p>The pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. GStreamer, being cross-platform, is used widely also on Win, Mac and on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.</p>\n<p>In addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.</p>\n<h4>Tooling</h4>\n<p>The many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex. We use Flatpak to build a dev env in which we know exactly what version of the dependencies exist. Thus you can create a working and stable dev env with minimal effort.</p>\n",

Plan 9 demonstrates a new and often cleaner way to solve most systems problems. The system as a whole is likely to feel tantalizingly familiar to Unix users but at the same time quite foreign.</p>\n<p>In Plan 9, each process has its own name space. A process may rearrange, add to, and remove from its own name space without affecting the name spaces of unrelated processes. This includes the ability to mount a connection to a file server speaking 9P, a simple file protocol. The connection may be a network connection, a pipe, or any other file descriptor open for reading and writing with a 9P server on the other end. Customized name spaces are used heavily throughout the system, to present new resources (e.g., the window system), to import resources from another machine (e.g., the network stack), or to browse backward in time (e.g., the dump file system). For example, device drivers in Plan 9 work by exposing a 9P server, typically mounted in /dev, and can be imported from other systems, transparently.</p>\n<p>Over time, Plan 9 has given rise to a number of offshoot projects. Inferno took many of the systems-level ideas, combined them with Limbo, a new concurrent programming language, and built them into a system which could run on bare hardware or hosted on another operating system. Plan9port takes many of the user-mode libraries and utilities and enables them to run on Unix-like systems. Each of these extends the ways Plan 9's ideas can be applied to different classes of problems.</p>\n<p>In addition to these directly related projects, ideas from Plan 9 have found their way into many other operating systems and environments. The /proc filesystem in several unixes, the rfork() call in various BSD systems, the 9P interface WSL uses to talk to Linux systems, and even UTF-8 all come from Plan 9. The concurrent programming model in Go came directly from that found in Inferno's Limbo.</p>\n",

We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process.

However, it is the Wiki community that created such a giant knowledge base. WikiLoop is an initiative to make tech people contribute back to the greater Wiki community including open knowledge institutions, academia and researchers who are interested in advancing computer-based technologies. With contributor's technical skillset and vision, typical WikiLoop projects help Wikipedia and its sister projects improve their knowledge sources and help the community by empowering humans and bootstrapping machines.</p>\n<p><strong>Tibetan Initiative: Preserving Precious Tibetan Buddhist Heritage</strong>\nOne of the targets of WikiLoop is to help knowledge institutions to preserve their precious knowledge. Tibetan language and culture is an example that could be benefited from WikiLoop.\nTibetan literature contains rich explorations of psychology, spirituality, and human experience continue to serve as a consistent source of inspiration to Western philosophy and psychology, as well as other modern sciences. There are millions of Tibetan speakers around the world. However, the Tibetan language is much underserviced in the digitized world. For example, it lacks modern NLP technologies such as machine translation, and basic NLP foundations such as tokenization. And existing efforts of knowledge preservation are isolated. So it is a good starting point for the WikiLoop project, where things could be connected to make a great impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Your GSoC Opportunity</strong>\nWe have a list of ideas targeting preserving Tibetan heritage but also could be expanded into a much larger scope by connecting other institutions and communities depending on students' preference.</p>\n",

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations. We also include junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, ASR, audio parsing, gesture analysis, media analysis, computer vision, and multimodal analysis.</p>\n<p>Red Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.</p>\n<p>For GSoC 2021, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).</p>\n",

There is also a large pool of capable and motivated contributors. The first mission of the Scala Center is to consult with the user community, define common goals, and organize contributions and its own resources to achieve these goals.\nThe Scala Center is a designated unit at EPFL, independent from the Scala research group (LAMP).</p>\n<h3>The Scala Language</h3>\n<p>Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\nScala is the technology of choice for a vibrant open-source ecosystem, including popular platforms and frameworks such as Spark, Kafka, Akka, Finagle, Cats, and Play, to name just a few.</p>\n<p>Scala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.</p>\n",

Originally focused on 2D Point&amp;Click adventure games, its scope widened in 2016 to RPG thanks to a successful GSoC students, and to 3D games in 2020 after the merge with its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.</p>\n<p>ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master and Hyperspace Delivery Boy. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run thounsands of games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 30 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 3,300,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.</p>\n<p>Since its merge with ResidualVM, ScummVM is also a 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files.</p>\n",

Hardware development is beginning to slow, and the free lunch is almost over.  In this climate, it is more important now than ever to rethink our traditional approaches to parallel computation.  New solutions must be developed with the scalability of applications being central to their design.</p>\n<p>The STE||AR Group is an international team of researchers who understand that a new approach to parallel computation is needed.  Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. The HPX runtime system is stirring up the pot by providing a modern implementation of all C++ standard facilities related to parallelism and concurrency, extended for the distributed use case.  HPX is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  For more information about HPX please see <a href=\"https://hpx.stellar-group.org/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. As you can see from our <a href=\"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-%28GSoC%29-2021\" target=\"_blank\">ideas page</a>, there are more possible projects for yourself to be involved with -- be creative!</p>\n<p>We envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently, HPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the future we hope to expand its influence to include common applications that touch our everyday lives.</p>\n",

It is capable to produce vector artwork and also can work with bitmap images.</p>\n<p>The main concept of Synfig is \"tweening\" - you can define object positions or shapes of vector objects at certain points of time and program will interpolate in-between frames automatically. You can also use bones to control your animation on higher level.</p>\n<p>With Synfig you can easily create motion graphics and cut-out animations for product explanation videos, tutorial videos, and more.</p>\n<h3>Main features</h3>\n<p><strong>- Vector tweening</strong>\nTransform any vector shape into another! Synfig gives you powerful tools to control every vertex of your vector artwork. Just set the key positions and inbetween frames will be calculated automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>- Layers and Filters</strong>\nSynfig provides 50+ layers to create artwork and animation of any complexity. Choose from various layer types: geometric, gradients, filters, distortions, transformations, fractals and others.</p>\n<p><strong>- Bones</strong>\nA bone system allows to create cutout animation using bitmap images or control your vector artwork. With an additional Skeleton Distortion layer it is possible to apply complex deformations to bitmap artwork.</p>\n<p><strong>- Linking elements</strong>\nYou can link parameters of various layers – directly or through mathematical expressions. This allows you to create advanced character puppets and other dynamic structures.</p>\n<h3>Examples of works created with Synfig</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecVv2IB7f5k\" target=\"_blank\">Morevna Episode 3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSL-NdoOLQc\" target=\"_blank\">Polar Detective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SF_-gJ0_w\" target=\"_blank\">Synfig Promo Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWAxFc9FPwA\" target=\"_blank\">Demo Reel by VanChatto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dVamedBYq8\" target=\"_blank\">The Deadline</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgSI3IcyXhs\" target=\"_blank\">Pluto takes life</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplify complex log data</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.</p>\n<p><strong>Databases destinations</strong></p>\n<p>If you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL,Oracle), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis.</p>\n<p><strong>Message queue support</strong></p>\n<p>syslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.</p>\n<p><strong>HTTP/REST support</strong></p>\n<p>syslog-ng supports sending messages to HTTP/REST services natively</p>\n<p><strong>Support language bindings</strong></p>\n<p>Want to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.</p>\n",

From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.\nTARDIS provides a link between theory and observations: by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and comparing these to observations, we can both interpret data and test models for why, when and how supernova explosions occur.\nWe, the community around TARDIS, are interested in combining astronomy, computer science, statistics and modern software design to build a tool that is useful both in research and teaching alike (with supporting documentation that would, in theory, allow anyone to recreate the project from scratch).</p>\n",

ENIGMA makes it refreshingly easy to stand up simple games. Recreating Atari Pong is a job for a handful of minutes. This is true in many modern engines, but unlike most, ENIGMA scales well to positively enormous games, as the engine (and ultimately, all user code) is written in C++.</p>\n<p>Users write code in EDL, a language similar to JavaScript (or, more to the point, Game Maker Language) which compiles intermediately to C++. The emitted C++ is optimized based on the game's asset usage, and the result is a C++ game project which can be built by any C++ compiler (we target Clang and GCC). This offers massive portability and library support.</p>\n<p>The compiler bundles a C++ parser which crawls the engine for definitions. This theoretically allows users to access library routines directly (e.g. OpenGL), though we recommend against this for portability reasons. This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.</p>\n<p>To really understand the utility of the project, consider a typical game, which uses \"rooms\" (a type of ENIGMA asset) to lay out instances of \"objects\" (game entity classes) visually. The objects contain code for specific events (such as step, draw, or keyboard) which can call out to scripts or begin timelines or start movement on paths. ENIGMA's compiler translates this to C++ and builds it against the engine after parsing both to learn how to integrate them.</p>\n",

We accomplish this via:</p>\n<p>Awareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals &amp; organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.</p>\n<p>Tools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.</p>\n<p>Information - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>\n<p>The Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&amp;D projects, and to recruit active new members.</p>\n",

Our community of users (including many past GSoC and GSoD students!) has built state of the art packages for differential equations, machine learning, differentiable programming, mathematical optimization, physical modeling, and probabilistic programming. A Summer of Code project in Julia is an opportunity to work at the bleeding edge of any of these exciting fields.</p>\n<p>Work on the core language is welcome, but we are also acting as an umbrella organization for several packages in the Julia ecosystem. The major ones include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fluxml.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Flux</a>, for machine learning;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CuArrays.jl\" target=\"_blank\">CuArrays.jl</a> and the GPU programming stack;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/\" target=\"_blank\">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>, for solving differential equations;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://turing.ml/\" target=\"_blank\">Turing.jl</a> for probabilistic programming.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As well as contributions to packages, we welcome self-contained projects that use these tools to do something interesting. For example, previous students have written speech recognition and reinforcement learning (e.g. AlphaGo) models for Flux’s model zoo, or been involved in our Neural ODEs work.</p>\n",

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.33 in January 2021). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview/Statistics page</a>), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users\" target=\"_blank\">Google Groups forum</a>) of over 9500 members as of February 2021, averaging over 8 posts per day. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 295 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.</p>\n",

A significant proportion of our software contributions come from university students studying software engineering. Participants often come from under-served communities or geographic areas and are sponsored through our various programs. This prepares them for the competitive realities of the working world.\nLife started for us in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.  We knew academic and student leadership wanted greater practical exposure to the latest technology. In response, our pilot Calico program for Jamaican universities was created with the goal of addressing the issues graduates would face when employed. \nAfter five years of success, members of the Jamaican diaspora suggested we expand our service area to be global. They saw similar needs in their own under-served communities where the digital divide is very visible and thought our experience in the developing world would be useful.\nWe have had many open-source projects. For the past three years we have focused on creating a mobile app to help community organizations like ourselves better manage their membership. We saw the need for a social media component to keep in contact with our volunteers. We also faced challenges with the project management of events and keeping track of volunteer abilities, roles and responsibilities. \nWe want to make the app useful for any community-based organization such as clubs, small religious institutions, neighborhood groups, and volunteer associations. We also want to see how the software could be installed as a multi-tenant, multi-site hosted service like WordPress as many of these organizations often don’t have sufficient IT skills. We hope that our GSoC students will help us achieve this goal in 2021.</p>\n",

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.</p>\n<p>Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.</p>\n<p>R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.</p>\n",

We've been working for years on educational awareness, challenging architecture, powerful developer workspaces, fun content, and much more.</p>\n<p>Our contributors are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians of all ages. We encourage and appreciate contributions from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to newcomers.</p>\n<h3>Our Games</h3>\n<p>Terasology is a highly extensible open source voxel-based game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world.</p>\n<p>From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and modular game. We host a large amount of game content modules under the Terasology organization on GitHub, all community maintained. We welcome new ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on IRC, Discord, or Slack.</p>\n<p>Destination Sol is a fun little space arcade shooter we adopted as open source to learn more about LibGDX, releasing on Steam and Google Play, and to have somewhere to apply our frameworks.</p>\n<h3>Architecture.</h3>\n<p>Our engine is meant to be light, secure, and flexible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. Game distributions then include modules that provide basic gameplay.</p>\n<p>Content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates. Creating a new module is as easy as running a single command, same for fetching source for any existing community module.</p>\n<p>The game itself can auto-download modules if needed with full dependency resolution included!</p>\n",

The software originates at the Databases and Information Systems (DBIS) research group of the University of Basel, Switzerland and has evolved into a thriving community involving people inside and outside of academia who’s common interest is multimedia retrieval.</p>\n<p>The vitrivr-stack and individual components thereof have won various awards over the years. The stack consists of three independent systems written in Java, Kotlin and Typescript:</p>\n<p>Cottontail DB: Is a column store that combines classical boolean retrieval and vector space retrieval used for multimedia search in a unified data and query model. It can be used as a standalone component independent of vitrivr and queries can be formulated through a gRPC API.</p>\n<p>Cineast: Is a feature extraction and query engine, that generates feature descriptors - often vectors - stores them in the database layer or uses them for lookup. Furthermore, Cineast fuses results generated by different feature modules to produce the final output. Cineast can be interacted with through REST as well as gRPC.</p>\n<p>vitrivr NG: Is our user-interface written in Angular / Typescript. It offers different means of query formulation, displays results and enables exploration of results and individual items.</p>\n<p>Together, these three components make up a self-contained system for an end-to-end multimedia retrieval experience. In addition to supporting various media types, the stack also offers support for different query modes such as Query-by-Example, Query-by-Sketch, Text-based queries etc. The modular nature of the stack allows for easy extension on many different levels and integration with machine learning methods using completely different ecosystems.</p>\n",

It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other team chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively via its unique threading model. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and much more -- essentially everything you might want.</p>\n<p>Unlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 700 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.</p>\n<p>Zulip is known for its extensive developer documentation (150,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application. Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of one or more major components by the end of the program.</p>\n<p>As an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot about how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.</p>\n",
